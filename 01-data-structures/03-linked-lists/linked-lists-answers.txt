1. What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?

Spatial locality is a characteristic of how programs access data. In order to be this, the  items being referenced are close in space to each other, like in an Array. There is a large benefit in this because all the items are located nearby and are able to be located by their indices, which provides for good performance.

2. Compare the time it takes to create a 10,000 item Array to appending 10,000 items to a Linked List.

For a 10,000 item array, the time it takes to create is 0.002599. To append 10,000 node items to a linked list, it takes 1.840839 seconds.

To search for the 5000th index in the array, it takes 0.000085 seconds, while searching for it in the Linked List takes 0.000333 seconds.

To delete at the 5000th index in the array, it takes 0.000048 seconds. Deleting the 5000th node in a Linked List takes 0.000193 seconds.

Overall we can see that arrayâ€™s are much faster in performance, however they take up much more memory.
